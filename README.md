Some messages encourage hydration, movement, stretching, posture, breathing, and taking care of eyesight. Others encourage calm, gratitude, or positivity. The bot may occasionally give you tasks that that draw attention to your surroundings. They re-engage the senses and pull focus away from screens. Some social prompts involve reaching out or recalling others. They fight isolation and reinforce interpersonal bonds. Lastly, the bot will give gentle reminders about cleaning, planning, or completing tasks. These promote order and small productivity wins.
