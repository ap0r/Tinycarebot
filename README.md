### **What is this?**
**Tinycarebot** is an applet that will reside in a panel of your choice and display a message every five minutes. The messages revolve around the themes of **body, mind, environment, social ties,** and **practical order**.

Some messages encourage hydration, movement, stretching, posture, breathing, or resting your eyes. Others promote calm, gratitude, and positivity. Occasionally, the bot suggests tasks that draw attention to your surroundings, helping you re-engage your senses and step away from the screen. Social prompts remind you to reach out or think of others, reducing isolation and reinforcing connection. Finally, practical reminders help with cleaning, planning, and completing small tasks — simple steps toward order and productivity.

If you want to add, remove, or change a message just edit the `messages.json` file with your favorite text editor.
