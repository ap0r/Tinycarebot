### **What is this?**
**Tinycarebot** is an applet that will reside in a panel of your choice and display a message every five minutes. The messages revolve around the themes of **body, mind, environment, social ties,** and **practical order**.

Some messages encourage hydration, movement, stretching, posture, breathing, or resting your eyes. Others promote calm, gratitude, and positivity. Occasionally, the bot suggests tasks that draw attention to your surroundings, helping you re-engage your senses and step away from the screen. Social prompts remind you to reach out or think of others, reducing isolation and reinforcing connection. Finally, practical reminders help with cleaning, planning, and completing small tasks — simple steps toward order and productivity.

At any time, you can get a new message by clicking the applet. By default, Tinycarebot includes 116 positive, healthy messages, so you are sure to have variety.
If you want to add, remove, or change a message just edit the `messages.json` file with your favorite text editor.

### **How to install?**

 1. Download the files. 
 2. Go to `/home/your user name/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/` and create a folder named
    `tinycarebot@ap0r`.
 3.  Navigate to `/home/your user name/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/tinycarebot@ap0r`, and place the downloaded files there.

Once that is done, the applet should be available to add to any panel. 
**Note:** It will look best on horizontal panels.
